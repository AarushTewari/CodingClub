This project uses Nodejs, express, and mongodb. As I have applied for the backend vertical I didn't put much effort in frontend, this blog app would work well on mobile devices too, but its responsiveness could be improved by putting more time into front end. The blogs in this app are arranged in order of newest first

For setting up the project first we need a package.json file which can be created by npm init -y command

To run this project the modules required to be installed are nodemon, express, mongoose, ejs, method-override, they can be installed from the command npm i express mongoose ejs method-override nodemon
