This project uses Nodejs, express, and mongodb. It implements all the CRUD operations as specified. As I have applied for the backend vertical I didn't put much effort in frontend, this blog app would work well on mobile devices too, but its responsiveness could be improved by putting more time into front end. The blogs in this app are arranged in order of newest first

For setting up the project first we need a package.json file which can be created by npm init -y command

To run this project the npm modules required to be installed are nodemon, express, mongoose, ejs, method-override, marked, slugify they can be installed from the command npm i express mongoose ejs method-override nodemon marked slugify. For more details check out package.json file. You won't see nodemon under the dependencies in the package.json folder because I had it globally installed on  my system, if you use the above command to install nodemon you would be able to see it in dependencies.

**There is a file video.html that contains a video which shows the implementation of the project as a proof of its functionality.**
